# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## USER STORY:

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## PSEUDOCODE

<!--  
1. build a home page with the current date at the top
2. create a section below with boxes for different times of the work day
2.1 left section will display time, center will be user input events, right will be a save feature
3. each time-block will be color-coded based on "past, present, or future"
3.1 create js to track time-blocks usage
4. each time block can be clicked on in order to add inner text
4.1 create event listener that enables user input on click
4.2 have a save button that saves user input to local storage, using onclick event listener
5. the saved events should remain even upon a refresh of the page (store info to local storage)  -->

## Project Objective  
We attempted to conceive and execute a design with our team that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests to create an interactive Holiday Database. We worked collaboratively, and learned agile development methodologies and implemented features, functions and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.   
## Description  
Holly is a web app that allows users to educate themselves about holidays and events that happen around the world every day and other interesting facts.  
## User story  
User 1 - The user wants a website to go that will show them what holidays are being celebrated around the world on that day. I want to be able to celebrate and learn something interesting every day of the year.  
User 2 - As a traveler, I want to be informed of all the holidays taking place when Iâ€™m traveling to a certain country, so I can better adapt to the culture of that country.
